# MailCheck.DomainStatus 
The Mail Check DomainStatus Microservice is responsible for collecting the Dkim/Spf/Dmarc/TlsRpt evaluated statuses for a domain. These statuses are then saved to a database.
You should have a database connection established with the DomainStatus DB when running any project which contains a DAO folder.
